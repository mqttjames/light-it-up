# Light It Up! â€“ Arduino-Enhanced Board Game

**Light It Up!** is an educational and interactive board game that teaches players about **e-waste recycling** and **energy efficiency**.  
Players move around a circular board, collecting and processing e-waste while balancing their water and energy usage.  
The goal is to be the first to reach the **Light-Up Threshold** or have the highest score when time runs out.

This repository contains the **Arduino code and wiring** that powers the game's physical elements â€” including a central light bulb and buzzer for audio feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ Gameplay Overview

- **Theme:** E-waste recycling & energy efficiency  
- **Players:** 2â€“6  
- **Average Play Time:** ~15 minutes  
- **Winning Conditions:**
  - **Light-Up Victory:** The first player to reach the point threshold (20 points for 2â€“3 players, 15 points for 4â€“6 players) presses the Light-Up Button, turning on the bulb and winning instantly.
  - **Time Victory:** If time runs out before anyone reaches the threshold, the player with the highest score wins, and the End Button is pressed to light the bulb.

## ðŸŽ® How It Works in the Game
1. **Start of Game:** Press the **Start Button** â€” the buzzer beeps to signal the game has begun.
2. **During Play:** Players move around the board, collect points, and encounter hazards.
3. **Threshold Reached:** If a player hits the threshold, they press the **Light-Up Button** â€” the bulb turns on and the buzzer sounds.
4. **Time Runs Out:** If no one reaches the threshold in time, press the **End Button** â€” the bulb still lights and the buzzer sounds.
